# Potato_leafs_detection_project
Description about the project:

This project focuses on **AI-powered potato leaf disease detection** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and TensorFlow**. A **Streamlit-based web application** allows users to upload leaf images and receive real-time disease classification into **Healthy, Early Blight, or Late Blight**. The system provides a **fast, accurate, and cost-effective solution** for farmers and researchers.
